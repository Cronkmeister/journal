## Upcoming Updates 

As mentioned before this is an on going project. I'm proud of what is there so far but there is a long way to go still, excited to improve the site and learn along the way. The first feautre to follow will be:
Working hard to move the database from a local source to a cloud based db. 
Login function will also be updated so that the site will be useful to separate users.
